# Comparative Analysis of U-Net-based Architectures on Medical Image Segmentation

This project presents a systematic comparison of several **U-Net-based architectures** for medical image segmentation.  
It evaluates each model under a unified experimental setup, analyzing their performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.

---

## Objectives

- Implement and compare different U-Net variants (e.g., **U-Net**, **UNet++**, **Attention U-Net**, **Residual U-Net**).  
- Train and evaluate models on medical imaging datasets (CT, MRI, histopathology, etc.).  
- Measure segmentation quality using **Dice**, **IoU**, **Precision**, and **Recall**.  
- Analyze trade-offs in model complexity, inference speed, and generalization.  
- Visualize segmentation outputs for qualitative comparison.
